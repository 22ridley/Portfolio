<br>
<p>
    At the end of my freshman year in high school, I won the <b>Algebra II</b> award for achieving the highest performance of all
    students taking Algebra II that year at my high school.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, at the culmination of my senior year, I won the <b>Senior Technology Award</b> for my contributions to technology
    programs at my high school. This includes my leadership as a <b>captain</b> on the DARC SIDE Robotics Team, participation in every computer
    science class offered at my high school, and technology outreach to younger students.
</p>

<p>
    For high achievement on the PSAT in October, 2020, I became a <b>National Merit Semifinalist</b>. After my submission
    of an essay along with a high score on the SAT, I became a <b>National Merit Finalist</b> in 2021. Along with this distinction,
    I won a scholarship of $2,500 to contribute to the cost of attending Brown University.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, I became an <b>AP Scholar with Honor</b> after I achieved all scores of 5 on my junior year of AP exams
    (AP Computer Science A, AP US History, AP Spanish Language, and AP Calculus BC). Then, I achieved all scores of 5 on
    my senior year of AP exams (AP Physics C: Mechanics, AP Statistics, and AP European History), so I became an <b>AP Scholar with Distinction</b>.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, during my senior year of high school, I was nominated as a <b>US Presidential Scholar Candidate</b>, along
    with only about 5,000 other students in the country.

    Athletic Awards

<h1>
    Volleyball
</h1>
<br>
<p>
    In my junior year on my high school's Varsity volleyball team, I won the <b>Coach's Reliability Award</b> for my
    dependability on and off the court. This volleyball team was incredibly important to me, so I always put my
    teammate's needs before my own.
</p>
<p>
    For this dedication to the team, I was also elected by my teammates to become a <b>captain</b> of the team in my senior year.
