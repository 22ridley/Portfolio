    Origins
</h1>
<br>
<p>
    My love of baking originated with my grandmother. Everytime my family visits her, she has an
    array of pastries, cakes, and cookies waiting for us. A tradition that will stick with me for
    my entire life is baking Christmas cookies. They may just be simple sugar cookies, but my
    cousins, sister and I go out all our when we decorate. We use colorful frosting, sprinkles, M
    &Ms, and everything else we have access to.

    Back at home, another Christmas treat that I baked were macarons. Let be honest: they look
    pretty bad. But whatever, it was my first time making them and they tasted great. We used
    chocolate and peppermint as our flavoring for the macarons, and like I said, they were awesome.
    At some point in the future, I will take another stab at macarons, and I think I might
    try a fruit flavor like lemon or raspberry. I am confident that my macarons will go better the next time around.

    Another choclate treat that I love to bake are brownies. Baking brownies is a whole lot
    easier than baking macarons, so I tend to choose brownies. At the time I took the picture
    of these brownies, I also baked strawberry scones. We baked both the brownies and the scones
    in a scone pan, and they turned out as eight cute corners. We made these treats for a spring
    party, and they were great snacks. We also made the flower shortbread cookies below for
    the party. They exemplify the spirit of spring perfectly. I discovered that shortbread is
    my favorite kind of cookie, and I can't wait to make even more in the future.

    One of my favorite treats I have ever made is strawberry sorbet. Yes, I know it shouldn't
    really fall under the baking category. But, I didn't really know where else to put it, and I
    definitely couldn't omit it from the website. Every summer, we pick strawberries at a local farm.
    One of the treats that we make is strawberry scones, which are above on this page. But making strawberry sorbet is even easier. First, we blend strawberries
    and lemon juice together with honey. Then, we pour that into our blender to crush the
    strawberries and smooth the mixture. Finally, we pour it into our ice cream maker.
    The final sorbet is delicious, and I like to tell myself that it's healthy too.

    Another fruity desert that I love is this pear crostada. We made this crostada as a
    Thanksgiving treat to go with our pies, and it was perfect. The pears were fresh and
    juicy, and the cinnamon mixture inside gave the dish perfect fall flavors. I love taking
    these before-and-after pictures and placing them beside each other. You can really see
    the difference after the crostada came out of the oven. The dough is golden brown and the
    pears look juicy and delicious. The feeling of successfully trying a new recipe made our
    Thanksgiving celebration even more special. I can't wait to make it again!
