    The best part about having a skill is being able to share it with others. I share my love
    of programming by volunteering with the national nonprofit TechGirlz. I am on the teen advisory
    board and I teach free STEM workshops for middle school girls. Before I volunteered for TechGirlz,
    I attended workshops as a student and fell in love with computer science. I teach a variety of
    classes, like programming in Python (shown in the image) and robotics. I have also spoken on behalf of
    TechGirlz at several events, like at the <a href="https://www.techgirlz.org/techgirlz-tab-member-sarah-ridley-at-the-women-in-mathematics-kickoff/">Women in Mathematics Kickoff</a>
    in Durham. I have also written several <a href="https://www.techgirlz.org/staying-connected-with-stem-during-the-pandemic-techgirlz-teen-volunteer-and-teen-advisory-board-member-sarah-ridley/">blog posts</a> for TechGirlz.

    Website
</h1>
<!-- Three different subpages and links to them -->
<br>
<p>
    The first of my programming projects that I'm proud to share is this website itself. In the summer of
    2020, I took the Harvard CS50 course, which was their Intro to Computer Science class. At the end,
    I learned HTML and created my first website. I didn't have a domain at that point, so I just ran my
    little website on a local host. Then, in the fall of 2020 to the spring of 2021, I worked for the
    Healthtech Hunches website, where I learned website design using tools like Wordpress. When I decided
    to create my own website, I challenged myself to only use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The culmination
    of my work building those skills is this website before you.

    Critter Sitter App
</h1>
<br>
<p>
    In the summer of 2021, I attended an engineering camp where I participated in a General Electric sponsored
    design challenge, and my team won third place. We designed a pet feeding machine that we called the Critter Sitter,
    which I have on the Robotics and Mechanics page. To pair with that machine, I coded this app.

    Weather Updates App
</h1>
<br>
<p>
    I challenged myself to create a program that would run on my computer daily, and I decided to code
    an application that would post the daily weather each morning when I opened my laptop. Through this project,
    I used the Tomorrow API, which allows the application to get a lot of data on the day's predicted weather.
    Then, the program extracts the pieces of information that I want to display in my notification, which
    includes the temperatures, chance of rain, and general description (sunny, cloudy, etc).

    Palette Designer
</h1>
<br>
<p>
    Another time that I was experimenting with applications on my computer, I created a palette designer that I can
    use when creating the color scheme for my art projects. You can add as many panels to the palette as you want,
    and then you can change the color of these panels using their hex codes.
</p>
<p>
    I have actually used this tool to help me visualize the fabrics or color scheme that I want to use
    on drawings and sewing projects like quilts. I always lean towards pinks, purples, and peaches in my art, but this palette
    auto loads with random colors. This random combination pushes me out of my comfort zone and inspires me to use
    different colors and combinations. Being able to use my creations in my everyday life is very
    rewarding, and the practicality of Computer Science and programming is part of what makes me love it
    so much.
