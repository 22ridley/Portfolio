    The best part about having a skill is being able to share it with others. I share my love
    of programming by volunteering with the national nonprofit TechGirlz. I am on the teen advisory
    board and I teach free STEM workshops for middle school girls. Before I volunteered for TechGirlz,
    I attended workshops as a student and fell in love with computer science. I teach a variety of
    classes, like programming in Python (shown in the image) and robotics. I have also spoken on behalf of
    TechGirlz at several events, like at the <a href="https://www.techgirlz.org/techgirlz-tab-member-sarah-ridley-at-the-women-in-mathematics-kickoff/">Women in Mathematics Kickoff</a>
    in Durham. I have also written several <a href="https://www.techgirlz.org/staying-connected-with-stem-during-the-pandemic-techgirlz-teen-volunteer-and-teen-advisory-board-member-sarah-ridley/">blog posts</a> for TechGirlz.

<h1>
    Website
</h1>
<!-- Three different subpages and links to them -->
<br>
<p>
    The first of my programming projects that I'm proud to share is this website itself. In the summer of
    2020, I took the Harvard CS50 course, which was their Intro to Computer Science class. At the end,
    I learned HTML and created my first website. I didn't have a domain at that point, so I just ran my
    little website on a local host. Then, in the fall of 2020 to the spring of 2021, I worked for the
    Healthtech Hunches website, where I learned website design using tools like Wordpress. When I decided
    to create my own website, I challenged myself to only use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The culmination
    of my work building those skills is this website before you.

    Rideshare Fare Predictor
</h1>
<br>
<p>
    This rideshare fare predictor was my first project in my Advanced CS: Data Science and AI class that I took in my
    senior year of high school. I wrote all the code for this project in python. First, I used the pandas library
    functions to make an SVC (Support Vector Classification) predictive model for based on data about the prices of
    rideshare services that I found on Kaggle. I also used geopandas to make the map that shows up on the right side
    of the GUI. To make the GUI itself, I used the tkinter library.

    Mancala Game

<p>
    The second project I made for this class was a game of mancala. Even if you don't recognize the name 'mancala', you
    might have played it before because it's very popular. It's a two player game where the goal is to end up with the
    most marbles in your pot at the end. You take turns moving marbles according to specific rules, which I won't get into.
    In my game, you play against the computer, which is programmed using search trees and alpha-beta pruning. The computer
    makes a tree with every possible move, pruning some branches as it goes with alpha-beta cutoffs, and then chooses the best
    move. Depending on how many moves you let the computer look ahead to (which correlates with how many layers of the tree it
    will create), the computer can become virtually unbeatable!

    A* Pathfinding Across the United States
</h1>
<br>
<p>
    For my third project in this Advanced CS class, I coded an A* pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest distance
    across a map of the United States with randomly generated obstacles. The obstacles include water and mountains, which
    do not accurately represent the landscape of the United States (because they are randomly generated). Each green block
    is a viable step on the path, and the number on each green block represents how many steps away from the start it is. When the
    "Find Shortest Path" button is pressed, the algorithm then finds the shortest path and highlights the steps in white. The starting point is always in Washington and the end
    point is always in North Carolina. However, the obstacles generate differently each time, so the shortest path is always
    different.

<h1>
    COVID Symptoms Chatbot
</h1>
<img class="wrapped" src="Images/COVIDChatBot.png" alt="COVID Chatbot GUI">
<br>
<p>
    For my final project in this class, I created a COVID symptoms chatbot. This was a challenging project, so I got help
    from websites <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-a-chatbot-with-python-deep-learning-in-less-than-an-hour-56a063bdfc44">like these</a>.
    The idea of this chatbot is to ask the user questions about their COVID symptoms and general behavior (including exposure and mask-wearing)
    and make a prediction about the likelihood of the user having COVID. The prediction algorithm uses a Random Forest Classifier
    model based on data about COVID symptoms and cases from Kaggle. Then, the chatbot recommends options for treatment. Instead of statically
    asking a series of questions, however, the chatbot uses deep learning to properly react to whatever the user enters, even if it doesn't fit
    the expected response pattern. The chatbot is definitely not perfect, as the user still needs to be clear with their responses for
    the chatbot to make a prediction. And of course, this chatbot could not replace a real doctor, but who knows! Telehealth might be the future of health care.

    Critter Sitter App
</h1>
<br>
<p>
    In the summer of 2021, I attended an engineering camp where I participated in a General Electric sponsored
    design challenge, and my team won third place. We designed a pet feeding machine that we called the Critter Sitter,
    which I have on the Robotics and Mechanics page. To pair with that machine, I coded this app.

    Weather Updates App
</h1>
<br>
<p>
    I challenged myself to create a program that would run on my computer daily, and I decided to code
    an application that would post the daily weather each morning when I opened my laptop. Through this project,
    I used the Tomorrow API, which allows the application to get a lot of data on the day's predicted weather.
    Then, the program extracts the pieces of information that I want to display in my notification, which
    includes the temperatures, chance of rain, and general description (sunny, cloudy, etc).

<h1>
    Palette Designer
</h1>
<br>
<p>
    Another time that I was experimenting with applications on my computer, I created a palette designer that I can
    use when creating the color scheme for my art projects. You can add as many panels to the palette as you want,
    and then you can change the color of these panels using their hex codes.
</p>
<p>
    I have actually used this tool to help me visualize the fabrics or color scheme that I want to use
    on drawings and sewing projects like quilts. I always lean towards pinks, purples, and peaches in my art, but this palette
    autoloads with random colors. This random combination pushes me out of my comfort zone and inspires me to use
    different colors and combinations. Being able to use my creations in my everyday life is very
    rewarding, and the practicality of Computer Science and programming is part of what makes me love it
    so much.
