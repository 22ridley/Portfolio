<p>
    Hi again! Here's a little bit more about me.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    I began coding in middle school, and since then, I have learned more about programming in high school
    classes. I took AP Computer Science A in my junior year of high school and really enjoyed it. I
    joined my high school's DARC SIDE robotics team in my sophomore as well as taking robotics classes, and I've
    really enjoyed them. You can read more about those experiences on the <a href="robotics.shtml">robotics</a> page!
    But, my interest in robotics and machines began ten years ago when I learned how to sew. Ever since, I have
    been fascinated with how my sewing machine works. Some of my favorite sewing projects have been quilts,
    masks, tote bags, and more. You can read about some of my projects on the <a href="sewing.shtml">sewing</a> page.

    Although I don't quite understand how my sewing machine works, working to understand the mechanics has occupied me
    for many hours. The mysteries of my sewing machine also pushed me to take those robotics and computer science classes
    and join the DARC SIDE robotics team, and I couldn't be more grateful.
    Additionally, my interest the intersection between sewing and robotics was actually the topic of my
    Common Application essay. I'm very proud of that essay, and I definitely think it helped me get into Brown University,
    which I applied to Early Decision in the fall of 2021. I am very happy to say that I was accepted! At Brown, I
    intend to concentrate (or 'major') in computer science.
