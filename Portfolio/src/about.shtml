    Hi again! Here's a little bit more about me.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    I began coding in middle school, and since then, I have learned more about programming in high school
    classes. Most recently, I took AP Computer Science and really enjoyed it. I joined my high school's
    robotics team in high school as well as taking robotics classes, and I've really enjoyed them. My
    interest in robotics and machines began ten years ago when I learned how to sew. Ever since, I have
    been fascinated with how my sewing machine works. Some of my favorite sewing projects have been quilts,
    masks, tote bags, and more. On an unrelated note, the next two tabs on my website are cooking and
    baking. Before the pandemic, I barely did any cooking or baking, but I picked up these skills with my
    extra free time. I hope you check out some of the recipes I have posted. Anyways, the last tab on the
    site is volleyball. I began playing volleyball when in seventh grade, and I have played on a school and
    club team ever since. And during the pandemic, I also picked up sand volleyball because I felt safer
    playing an outdoor sport.

    Again, thank you for taking the time to view my online portfolio.
