<h2>
    Volleyball
</h2>
<br>
<h1>
    School
</h1>
<br>
<p>
    I made the Varisty volleyball team in my sophomore year of high school. That year, the fall
    of 2019, we won 2nd place in the NCISAA (North Carolina Independent Schools Atheltic Association)
    State Tournament. I also played on the team my junior and senior years, despite COVID. In
    my senior year, my teammates elected me to be a captain, which was an amazing experience.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    I have played a few different positions at volleyball, from outside hitter to libero. The best
    part about playing volleyball on my school team is that I'm building my relationships with my friends
    and spending a ton of time with them. Volleyball has also helped me become more resilient and improve
    my leadership skills.

    Indoor Club
</h1>
<br>
<p>
    I played indoor club volleyball for four years, from seventh grade through tenth grade. The school
    season is August through October, so the indoor season is from November to May. I played on travel
    teams, so I got to go to tournmanets in cities like Orlando, Charlotte, and Richmond.

    Outdoor Club
</h1>
<!-- Three different subpages and links to them -->
<br>
<p>
    I began playing outdoor sand volleyball in the spring of 2020 when the pandemic hit. My indoor
    volleyball season was canceled, so I decided to play outdoors instead. I did some lessons that
    spring and summer, and then I played on a club sand team in the winter and spring of 2021. It was
    a travel team, so I played in tournaments in Virginia Beach and Raleigh. Sand volleyball was a challenge for me,
    not just because the technique was new, but because I only had one teammate. This forced me to take on
    more responsibility and leadership on the court.
