    Home Grown Ingredients
</h1>
<br>
<p>
    One of my favorite parts of cooking is that I get to use home grown ingredients from
    my families garden. Here is a picture of a red pepper that we grew. We also grow basil,
    thyme, red tomatoes, yellow tomatoes, arugula, bok choy, cilantro, parsley, and spinach. We have made a ton
    of meals with these ingredients, and many of them are shown in the picture below. Cooking
    feels even more special when the ingredients come from your own garden. Not to mention
    how fresher ingredients make delicious meals!

    We made salsa with a lot of these ingredients. We used red peppers, red tomatoes, yellow
    tomatoes, and cilantro from our garden. We also bought onions from the store, so it wasn't
    completely home grown. But still, we had the right idea! This salsa was probably the most
    flavorful salsa I've ever had, and it was delicious with chips.

    My all time favorite dish to cook is shrimp scampi. My sister found this recipe in one of Ina
    Garten's cookbooks, and we decided to try it. Ina Garten is my mom's favorite chef, and she didn't
    let us down. The dish is delicious, and the strong lemon flavor pairs perfectly with the shrimp,
    linguine, red pepper flakes, garlic, and parsley. The parsley is home grown, which makes it even
    better. We cook this dish about once every two weeks, and we have become experts. I don't think
    I will ever get bored of this dish.

    Another dish that has become my favorite is homemade pizza. Well, it's not really homemade, because
    we buy the dough, sauce, and cheese from Trader Joe's, my all time favorite grocery store. However,
    we did use peppers and tomatoes from our garden on half the pizza. On the other half, we usually keep
    it plain with just cheese. Pizza is the best food ever, and making it at home is super fun and easy.
    Just like all of these meals, the best part is making them with my family. Working in the kitchen
    together gives us time to bond and destress together.
