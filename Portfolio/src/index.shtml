    Hi! My name is Sarah Ridley and I'm a freshman at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. I plan to concentrate
    in computer science, and this website is my
    personal portfolio that I coded myself. I've used tools like WordPress to make smaller webpages when I was younger, but I decided to
    code this website with no extra tools. So, everything you see is a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    The only drawback is that there might be some errors! Please use the 'Contact' tab below to let me know if you find
    any issues, or if you want to reach out for any other reason.
</p>
<p>
    I fell in love with coding in middle school, and this website has allowed me to create a tangible
    project that I can easily share with others. The beauty of this website is that I can also use it to share
    my other interests. Believe it or not, coding is not my only hobby! I also love robotics,
    sewing, baking, cooking, and volleyball. If you want to learn more about my interest in <a href="programming.shtml">programming</a>,
    <a href="robotics.shtml">robotics</a>, or <a href="sewing.shtml">sewing</a>, please check out those tabs!
    I have lots of projects that I'm excited to share.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, you can learn more about who I am on the <a href="about.shtml">about</a> page, where I write about how I discovered these interests. Finally, the <a href="awards.shtml">awards</a> tab serves as a
    log of my accomplishments, so please check it out if you're interested!
</p>
<p>
    Again, because I built this website from scratch (with the help of many articles and forums online), there is a
    chance that you will find a bug. If you're willing to go the extra
    mile, please contact me and tell me about the problem so that I can fix it! You can find my information on the
    'Contact' tab on the bottom bar.
</p>

<p>
    Please explore my portfolio!

    Photos on this page:
</h2>
<br>
<p>
    The first photo is from when I worked a summer program run by my robotics team, called DARC SIDE. This
    camp was for elementary school ages kids, and we were using First Lego League kits to introduce them to
    robotics and build interest in the First Robotics Competition program, which is the league that my team
    competes in. In this photo, I am giving a tour of our robotics lab to the students. You can learn more
    about this on the <a href="robotics.shtml">robotics</a> tab.
</p>

<p>
    The second photo is from when I was finishing a quilt that I sewed for an English project at the end of
    my junior year. The process of finishing a quilt includes sewing lines or patterns over fabric that has already been
    sewn together to create the background of the quilt. These seams that run along the top and the bottom give the quilt more
    depth and an elevated look of precision. This quilt was so much fun to make and I learned so much about the craft! You can find
    more about this specific quilt on the <a href="sewing.shtml">sewing</a> tab.
