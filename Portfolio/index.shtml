            My most recent professional experience is working as a Software Development 
            Engineering Intern at Amazon Audible in Summer 2024. I joined the Player team
            to work on a backend project for 12 weeks in Newark, New Jersey.

            Previously, I spent Summer 2023 working as a Site Reliability Engineering
            Intern at Pearson Education in Durham, North Carolina. I spent 10 weeks at Pearson working on creating
            a cloud-based AI chatbot to query internal Pearson documentation. In this role,
            I also studied for and earned my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification.

        In the winter of 2024, I joined the <a href="https://etos.cs.brown.edu" target="_blank">ETOS</a> 
        research group at Brown University. I've had the opportunity to learn Rust and work on a research project
        focusing on privacy preserving systems, specifically using policy-protected data. I'm excited about
        future opportunities to continue expanding my skills in a research context.

        <div>
            In my first semester of college, I joined Hack@Brown, which organizes Brown University's annual hackathon. 
            Students at Brown and from colleges across the US come to Brown to compete in the hackathon. I became a part of the Dev team, where I learned React to help create the 
            <a href="https://2023.hackatbrown.org/" target="_blank">2023 website</a> for the hackathon. The following year, I became a 
            co-lead for the Dev team, where I led the development of the <a href="https://2024.hackatbrown.org/" target="_blank">2024 website</a>.

            Rideshare Fare Predictor
        </div>
        <div>
            This rideshare fare predictor was my first project in my Advanced CS: Data Science and AI class that I took in my
            senior year of high school. This project is entirely written in Python. I used the pandas library
            functions to make an SVC (Support Vector Classification) predictive model for based on data about the prices of
            rideshare services found on Kaggle. I also used geopandas to make the map that shows up on the right side
            of the GUI. To make the GUI, I used the tkinter library.

            Alpha-Beta Pruning Mancala
        </div>
        <div>
            This game of mancala is also written in Python. The player plays against the computer, which uses search trees and alpha-beta pruning
            to pick its moves. 
            The computer makes a tree with every possible move, pruning some branches with alpha-beta cutoffs, and then chooses the best
            move. Depending on how many moves you let the computer look ahead to (which correlates with how many layers of the tree it
            will create), the computer can become virtually unbeatable.

            Face Masks

        <div>
            In the summer of 2020, I sewed 50 face masks and donated them to a birth center in Western North
            Carolina. I had never sewn face masks before, but during the beginning of the pandemic, demand
            for face masks was high. I chose bright, colorful fabrics for the face masks, and I found it fulfilling to know that my sewing
            skills have helped strangers. I have continued looking for other ways to use this passion to help others.

            Tote Bags

        <div>
            One of the most recent sewing projects I completed was a cream and pink tote bag. After my success with this tote bag, 
            I decided to sew DARC SIDE inspired
            tote bags as my parting gift to my robotics mentor and my co-captain. DARC SIDE is
            the name of my high school's robotics team. I used a very similar technique on these tote bags as my first tote bag, but I had to learn how to sew
            circular blocks. In the future, I hope to use this technique to make circular patterns on quilts.

            Quilts
        </div>
        <div>
            My absolute favorite type of sewing project is quilting. Quilts take much more time than
            any other sewing project on this page, and they are so incredibly rewarding. The pictures
            I included below show the process of one of my quilts, which I made as part of an English
            project last year. The quilt is about how the sewing machine simultaneously reduced women's
            work load to make clothes for their family, but also emphasized their domestic familial role.
            The symbols I show in this quilt are the Venus symbol, the globe, an old sewing machine, a new
            sewing machine, and a factory along the bottom. The factory and the globe represent how today,
            the labor of sewing clothing is outsourced to third world countries. This makes the price of
            clothing incredibly cheap, encouraging consumers to buy and subsequently waste more clothing.
            This process of harmful to our world because the workers do not earn living wages and because
            rising clothing production and waste have horrible implications for our climate.
